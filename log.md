## Logging Levels

The levels determine what type of events get logged:

- **critical**: Logs only critical errors that may crash the application.
- **error**: Logs critical errors and non-critical errors.
- **warning**: Logs warnings in addition to errors and critical errors.
- **info**: Logs informational messages, warnings, errors, and critical errors.
- **debug**: Logs all of the above, plus additional debugging information like HTTP request details, middleware operations, and ASGI events.
